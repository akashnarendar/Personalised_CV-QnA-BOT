Deep in the Himalayan range, beneath layers of glacial ice, archaeologists uncovered a sprawling underground city. Named Arathea, it predated known civilizations by at least 4,000 years. The city’s architecture was non-Euclidean, with curves folding into themselves and hallways that looped endlessly.

Among the artifacts was a crystal orb that pulsed with light when held, responding to brain waves. No written language was found, but wall carvings suggested a society that communicated via telepathy.

The discovery was kept secret due to its potential implications on human history—and reality itself.
