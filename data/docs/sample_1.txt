On a foggy morning in London, 1895, Dr. Elias Grey activated the ChronoCore for the first time. The device, a result of two decades of theoretical physics and alchemy, sparked with a pulse of blue light and vanished. Dr. Grey reappeared moments later, dazed but exhilarated, claiming he had visited the year 2473.

In his journal, he wrote of sky gardens that floated above cities, humans coexisting with AI, and a global system powered entirely by quantum energy. However, not everything was utopian—he noted a disturbing absence of emotion in the people of the future.

“I fear,” he wrote, “that the price of perfection is the soul.”
