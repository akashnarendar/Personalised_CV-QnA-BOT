Oct 2019 — Aug 2020        Machine Learning Engineer, Optisol Business Solutions        Chennai * Intelligent Document Analyzer : For Henkel, a billion dollar American chemical company, a project using various NLP techniques, a document was being parsed, analyzed to extract data and using TF-IDF vectorizer, a similarity matrix was built and compared against more than 10,000 documents to find if there were any similar/ older versions of the same document present. It also involved building APIs and deployment in Docker, AWS lambda function, AWS EC2 instance. * Classification model for patients treatment continuum : Built a classification model to identify patients who would continue their treatment for a trial drug for an international NGO. This included integration of a database and conversion of the model into an API to be deployed into an AWS instance. * Entity based sentiment analyzer of medical reviews: Using various NLP techniques, medical reviews were analyzed, tokenized and entity dependent parts were extracted. A classifier was trained to classify reviews into positive, negative or neutral. The extracted parts of the reviews were parsed in to get their sentiments analyzed and tagged to their respective entities. This also included integration of a database and building APIs for aforementioned pipeline along with the deployment in an azure system. Created customized applications to make critical predictions, automate reasoning and decisions, and calculate optimization algorithms. May 2019 — Aug 2019        Data Analyst, Greedy Game Media        Bengaluru * Performed extraction of unstructured data from S3 buckets which were sent in from APIs of SDKs integrated in games from users' device saved in a server and converted them to structured data and uploaded the data to multiple platforms such as Google BigQuery and MySQL depending on the type of analysis to be conducted. * Identified, built and documented end-to-end pipeline of user journey. * Performed in-depth analysis of KPIs on a daily basis and dug into details to discover what were driving those trends, if any present. * Performed 'Red-Alert' analysis of critical game performances * Performed campaign level and partner level optimization, increasing 35% of the revenue for 3 clients. Automated Metabase and developed effective dash boards to showcase the KPI performances of clients and self-run campaigns.
